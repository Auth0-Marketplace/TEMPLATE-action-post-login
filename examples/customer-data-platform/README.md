# Customer Data Platform (CDP) Example Action Integration

This example contains an Action that sends Auth0 profile data to a generic CDP. The code in this repo is meant to be used as a starting point for an Action integration with a similar purpose and should not be used as-is in production. 

**Please Note:** The code in this example should be used as an example to help write an Action integration, not used directly in production.
